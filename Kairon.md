## Background Features

### Military Rank

You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank.

You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use.

You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized. 

## Racial Traits

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in Darkness as if it were dim light. You canâ€™t discern colour in Darkness, only shades of grey.

### Hellish Resistance

You have Resistance (take half-damage) to fire damage.

### Infernal Legacy

You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Hellish Rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these Spells.

## Class Traits

### Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an Attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Second Wind

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On Your Turn, you can use a Bonus Action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or Long Rest before you can use it again.

### Action Surge

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On Your Turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible Bonus Action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or Long Rest before you can use it again.

### Champion: Improved Critical

Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
