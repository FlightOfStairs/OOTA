# Unnamed Player

## Background: Outlander (Bounty hunter)

You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You’ve witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don’t know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.

Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders.

* __Traits__:
    - I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups. (2)
    - I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won’t save you from a hungry owlbear. (5)
* __Ideal__: Greater Good. It is each person’s responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe. (2)
* __Bond__: My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me. (1)
* __Flaw__: I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies. (4)

## Background Features

### Wanderer

You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth. 

## Racial Traits: High Elf

### Darkvision

You have superior vision in dark and dim Conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in Darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in Darkness, only shades of gray.

### Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

### Trance

Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

### Cantrip - TODO

You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

## Class Traits: Ranger - Beastmaster

### Favoured Enemy: Dwarves, Orcs

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favoured enemies, as well as on Intelligence Checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one Language of your choice that is spoken by your favoured enemies, if they speak one at all.

### Natural Explorer: Forest

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural Environment and are adept at travelling and surviving in such regions. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favoured terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.

While travelling for an hour or more in your favoured terrain, you gain the following benefits:

* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
* Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while travelling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are travelling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

### Fighting Style: Two-weapon fighting

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Primeval Awareness

You can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): Aberrations, Celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, Fiends, and Undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.

### Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Beastmaster - Ranger's Companion: Panther

At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.

The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.

If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.

While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.

If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.

## Spells

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Speak with Animals

* 1st-level Divination
* Casting Time: 1 Action
* Duration: 10 Minutes
* Components: V, S

You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM's discretion.

### Hunter's Mark

* 1st-level Divination
* Casting Time: 1 Bonus Action
* Duration: 1 Hour (Concentration)
* Range: 90 ft
* Components: V

You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.

__At Higher Levels.__ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.

### Pass without Trace

* 2nd-level Abjuration
* Casting Time: 1 Action
* Duration: 1 Hour (Concentration)
* Components: V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

### Healing Spirit

* 2nd-level Conjuration
* Casting Time: 1 Bonus Action
* Duration: 1 Minute (Concentration)
* Range: 60ft
* Components: V, S

You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can’t heal constructs or undead.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

__At Higher Levels.__ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
