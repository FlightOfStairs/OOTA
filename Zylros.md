# Kairon

## Background Features

### Spy: Criminal Contact

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals.

You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you. 

## Racial Traits

### Darkvision

You have superior vision in dark and dim Conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in Darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in Darkness, only shades of gray.

### Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being Charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

## Class Traits

### Dark One's Blessing

When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).

## Spells

### Eldritch Blast

* Evocation cantrip
* Casting Time: 1 action
* Range: 120ft
* Components: V, S

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell Attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate Attack roll for each beam.

### Find familiar

Should probably be removed. Not a cantrip. Not on the Warlock spell list. Only usable by Pact of the Chain, not Pack of the Tome.

### Armor of Agathys

* 1st-level abjuration
* Casting Time: 1 action
* Range: Self
* Components: V, S, M (a cup of water)
* Duration: 1 hour

A protective magical force surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 cold damage.

___At Higher Levels.___ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the cold damage increase by 5 for each slot level above 1st.

### Burning Hands

* 1st-level evocation
* Casting Time: 1 action
* Range: Self
* Components: V, S
* Target: Every creature in a 15-foot cone

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

___At Higher Levels.___ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

### Mirror Image

* 2nd-level illusion
* Casting Time: 1 action
* Range: Self
* Components: V, S
* Duration: 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature Targets you with an Attack during the spell's Duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the Attack instead Targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an Attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an Attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

### Hold Person

* 2nd-level enchantment
* Casting Time: 1 action
* Range: 60ft
* Components: V, S, M (A small, straight piece of iron)
* Duration: Up to 1 minute
* Concentration

Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be Paralyzed for the Duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

___At Higher Levels.___ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target on additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
