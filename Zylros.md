## Background Features

### Spy: Criminal Contact

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals.

You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you. 

## Racial Traits

### Darkvision

You have superior vision in dark and dim Conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in Darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in Darkness, only shades of gray.

### Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being Charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

## Class Traits

### Dark One's Blessing

When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).

## Spells

### Eldritch Blast

* Evocation cantrip
* Casting Time: 1 action
* Range: 120ft
* Components: V, S

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell Attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate Attack roll for each beam.

### Find familiar

_Only as ritual - Book of Ancient Secrets_

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, Lizard, Octopus, owl, Poisonous Snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, Sea Horse, Spider, or Weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the Statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In Combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't Attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any Special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

Finally, when you Cast a Spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an Attack roll, you use your Attack modifier for the roll.

### Armor of Agathys

* 1st-level abjuration
* Casting Time: 1 action
* Range: Self
* Components: V, S, M (a cup of water)
* Duration: 1 hour

A protective magical force surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 cold damage.

___At Higher Levels.___ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the cold damage increase by 5 for each slot level above 1st.

### Burning Hands

* 1st-level evocation
* Casting Time: 1 action
* Range: Self
* Components: V, S
* Target: Every creature in a 15-foot cone

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

___At Higher Levels.___ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

### Mirror Image

* 2nd-level illusion
* Casting Time: 1 action
* Range: Self
* Components: V, S
* Duration: 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature Targets you with an Attack during the spell's Duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the Attack instead Targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an Attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an Attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

### Hold Person

* 2nd-level enchantment
* Casting Time: 1 action
* Range: 60ft
* Components: V, S, M (A small, straight piece of iron)
* Duration: Up to 1 minute
* Concentration

Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be Paralyzed for the Duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

___At Higher Levels.___ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target on additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## Eldritch Invocations

### Agonising Blast

When you cast Eldritch Blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

### Book of Ancient Secrets

You can now inscribe magical Rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level Spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The Spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of Spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen Spells as Rituals. You can’t cast the Spells except as Rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual Spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.
